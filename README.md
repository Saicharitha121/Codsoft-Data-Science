 CODSOFT is a vibrant and diverse community that brings together individuals with similar objectives and ultimate goals.
 Our main focus is on creating opportunities that span various areas, including leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering shared interests

 first Task:   TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
    Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
    The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
    
 Second Task:  SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
     Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience
     segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
     In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze
     and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies 
     and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python

Third Task : CREDIT CARD FRAUD PREDICTION
     Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
     Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
     Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
     Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
